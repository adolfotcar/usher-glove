Using Raspberry Pi to help Usher Syndrome affected people.

Someone deer to me was diagnosed with Usher Syndrome so I had this idea.

This allows Usher patients to communicate with the external world. The idea is that when someone types something in a keyboard connected to the Raspberry, an equivalent combination vibrates different fingers on the patient's glove. On the other hand, if the patient presses the buttons on the equivalent fingers it types into a display.

Project never went further than a prototype with LED because there are more popular alternatives that I didn't know at the time.  =)
